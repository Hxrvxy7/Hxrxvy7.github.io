    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>In this lesson we were learning how to make our blogs look different rather than the plain white background.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Make the blog yours and change the name, background and icon.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target?

  <tr>
    <td>I found that a good and effective way of doing this was by using helpful sources from the internet to help me in problems such as how to change the colour of a font. Also using the knowledge of my classmates and my own thinking as well. However, i should be keeping my head focused on the learning.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to use focus. When i'm in the lesson i should get straight on with the work. Rather than coming in and showing people my progress. This will help as i will be able to get things done quicker and more efficient. This will help my learning as i will learn more information that i need to make a great blog.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson i am going to take notes again and not take so long to choose things like my avatar and get them done and on to the next task. This is key for next lesson as i am going to work very hard and  have everything i need to do done. Also i may write notes of what we are doing to make this blog easier.</td>
