    <td>I find that taking notes helped my learning as it gave me a good insight on what abilities we have and how to use them very well. I have learned over the last 7 weeks that risks are sometimes worth taking as well as how to not get people to do our work and try to figure it out alone. I feel that this has given me a really valuable lesson these past 7 weeks as i can now say i made a blog with a working google sheet.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I Felt that to improve i can try my hardest at all times and that i really pays off. I feel the fact it was the end meant that if i had done everything asked of me then i couldn't add to it but at the same time i did a good amount of work but i donâ€™t think it is the highest level of difficulty possible. But seeing as i was an ameteur to github before i feel i have done a very good piece of work with a high amount of effort.

  <tr>
    <td>There will not be a next time for a few months now as we have finished but at some time before our next lesson i will try out some new things on Github and see what i can do. I will probably have a look at W3schools which is a great resource which helped me massively during these last weeks. t o improve i will always try my hardest and keep focused on the work as i feel my blog has some great potential</td>
