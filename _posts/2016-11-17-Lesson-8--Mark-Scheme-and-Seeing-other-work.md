    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We all had a blog and we were almost ready for it to be marked</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To successfully mark people's Blogs as a group.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> I feel we did as we understood the main principal of the Mark scheme, However there was a lot of chatting which distracted us and so we got in trouble as a class for the amount of talking </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt all about the Mark scheme and tried to figure out what mark i may have got. I also took notes which helped a lot as i could refer to them when marking and see where my blog fits in with the marking. I feel this was effective as it gave me self-belief that my work is good and has lots of interesting points. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I feel that as a class we were talking a lot and did deserve a form of punishment (which we were given) as we were not learning and just wasting our's and the teacherâ€™s time. I believe that this led to us not being able to see more pieces of work which could have helped us on what the standard was and how we could improve ours. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will do my bit and stay quiet unless being asked to speak. This will help as we could then get through the work efficiently. I will also help others more by giving them feedback on their work. This would help them and if we all did this it would work fine and everyone will have their work commented on and how we could all work on them. </td>
