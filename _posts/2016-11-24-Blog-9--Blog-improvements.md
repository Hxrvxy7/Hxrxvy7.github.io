(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt about the sort of mark i was looking to achieve and how to use sensible risks to decide whether to try something that i may not get done but could turn out very good. I feel i almost met it but i feel i can almost do it as long as i give myself courage to do so otherwise my blog may be too ordinary.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I feel that a major reason why i my learning was limited is because Github had crashed and so it took a long while for it to load and edit your work so that wasted a lot of time. I also feel i need to be more independent with my work and use my own rain to do my work. I feel that i took this away from the lesson and will now do the work by myself efficiently.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, hopefully github will have been fixed and so i can do my work quickly and move on to make it even better. As Well as this i am going to first, see how i can do it myself and actually think about it. Then i will search up ways to improve my blog and if it comes to it, which i hope it won't, i will ask for help.</td>
