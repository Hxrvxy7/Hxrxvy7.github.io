    <td>I learnt how to make the sheet so when you want a certain object you can select that and also how many of the object you would like. For example, say you want 2 blue paints and 4 pink paints, my sheet is going to able to tell you this with VAT and delivery. At the moment i'm figuring out how to do the delivery. I feel i succeeded as I understood the task easily as i knew what we as a class were talking about. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I felt as some points was asking for too much help but not enough that i didnâ€™t do anything because i still had to figure out some stuff. So taking notes would have helped a lot. In the lesson  i feel as if i got on with the work but some points i gave up instead of keep on trying. I Need to make sure i work on the task.

  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will make sure that i take notes as it will help me to understand the learning and so i can get on with the work independently and not be asking the teacher all the time. This will help me to become more independant. Also i will pay full attention when the teacher is talking to the rest of the class so i can succeed in making my google sheets.</td>
