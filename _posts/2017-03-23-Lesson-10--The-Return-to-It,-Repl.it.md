  <tr>
    <td>I learnt some basic and common pieces of code again and going back over it all made it so much easier to reach the target as i started off small and started to get back into complex terms and phrases. After going through this the task seemed simple.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Firstly, we had not had an IT lesson for a while so i had to cast back my mind to when we were learning repl.it and use previous information to help with my present work. This also didn't help that i was then out of shape with my python work so i had to gradually come back from  the basic.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>By next lesson i should be back to normal and have learnt where i went wrong so i'm back to my usual standard of work. This should hopefully be shown in the homework. This will definitely be back to usual by next week.</td>
