    <td>I learnt that a warm blog looks nice. I have also found out how to add and subtract different parts of an excel spreadsheet which i found very interesting. I got most parts of it and it was really good when it all came together with a click in my head. This spreadsheet is a really good idea and i am interested to see what it does to the blog and how i can put it in mine. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I feel i need some more focus but i did get down with the work today. I felt i couldn't do much as i struggled on a bit of excel which was tough but i understood it after we had figured it out. I Also need to take my ideas from different angles, such as wondering what will happen if i changed it to this and willing to take risks that could pay off really well.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will keep looking for new ideas on what to do and change my ideas for the better. I will also have made sure i refer anything that i struggled with and sort it out if it went wrong. Most of the time it is not the computerâ€™s fault but my own so i need to keep an extra eye out for that. Also full focus will really help as i will know what to do.</td>
