    <td>Firstly i found that it was best to take notes of how to do the task set in hand by making notes of what to do on my iPad. This was successful as i used them effectively to my advantage and was able to get the work done. As Well as this i learnt that it was good to fix my mistakes and instead of going straight to the teacher, seeing how i could fix them and then if i could not, i could ask for some assistance from my peers. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Firstly, something that limited my learning was silly errors. For example i could not seem to understand why my username popi then looked at it again and realised that i had spelt my username wrong, which was very stupid of me. I also need to work on try to fix the se problems independently, rather than the silly thing of going straight up to the teacher and asking him/her to do it for me.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that i will try to improve for next time by getting on with the work quicker and be more efficient wit my learning. Next time i am looking to fix all my problems by myself to help the teacher, students and myself to become a better more independent person. </td>
