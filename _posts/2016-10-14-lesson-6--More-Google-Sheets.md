    <td>I felt that taking notes was a good idea and it helped me to learn what to do and how to keep up with the work. It also gave me a chance to use as much of the time as possible. I Also learnt to try new and different things and not be afraid for failure. I think i payed close attention to what i did and it worked effectively.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I felt i could not work fully as i was struggling to understand ome of the work and could keep up with the task. I feel i need to work on getting the ask done quickly rather than seeing how fascinating it is and continue with the work. I will also not be afraid to ask questions if i don't understand how something works.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will get the work done quickly and have it at a high standard because i really enjoy what we are doing. I will also next time ask questions because they can really help me to have my work at its highest potential. However, i also need to make sure i donâ€™t ask too many questions so i am actually doing the work myself and not getting the teachers to do it for me which is something i have needed to work on in the past. </td>
